READ ME GENERATOR HOMEWORK


---USER STORY---

AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project


---ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA---

GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
WHEN I enter my project title
THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
WHEN I enter my GitHub username
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
WHEN I enter my email address
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents
THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README


---WHAT I GOT DONE---

i was able to make the user get prompted for the required questions and have it succesfully saved into a new readme.md file.
i wasn't able to make the badges work as i was totally confused what y'all meant by it and the github list of licenses i copied off of didn't have a badge for most of them on shield.io.
i also wasn't able to format it alot? it's not super ugly but it's super basic. when i was googling it kept mentioning markdown however i couldn't find anyhting on how that worked with node.js.
overall it works though! i'll probably stick to writing them myself though since i prefer that method.
